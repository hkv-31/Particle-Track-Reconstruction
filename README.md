# Particle Track Reconstruction with Machine Learning

A personal project exploring the application of **machine learning** for reconstructing **particle trajectories** from the **TrackML dataset**.  
This repository implements **clustering algorithms** to group 3D hit coordinates in particle detectors ‚Äî bridging **particle physics** and **data science**.

## üîç Project Overview

In experimental **particle physics**, charged particles leave traces ("hits") as they move through layered detector systems.  
The challenge is to **group these hits into individual particle tracks**, a process known as **track reconstruction**.  

This project tackles that challenge using **unsupervised learning algorithms** to cluster 3D hit data into meaningful trajectories.

## üìÅ Dataset

This project uses the **TrackML Particle Identification** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trackml-particle-identification),  
simulating detector hits from a collider experiment.  

Each event contains:
- 3D hit coordinates  
- Detector layer information  
- Ground-truth particle IDs (for benchmarking)
