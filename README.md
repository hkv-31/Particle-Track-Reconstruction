**Particle Track Reconstruction with ML**

A personal project exploring the application of machine learning for reconstructing particle trajectories from the TrackML dataset. This repository contains implementations of clustering algorithms to group 3D hit coordinates in particle detectors, serving as a bridge between particle physics and machine learning.

**Project Overview**

In experimental particle physics, charged particles leave traces ("hits") as they travel through layered detector systems. The challenge is to group these hits into individual particle trajectories, a process known as track reconstruction. This project tackles this problem using unsupervised learning algorithms.

**Key Features**

i. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the TrackML dataset to understand hit distributions and detector geometry.

ii. Implementation of clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN) using Scikit-learn to group hits into potential particle tracks.

iii. 3D visualization of hit data and clustering results using Matplotlib.

iv. A modular codebase for easy experimentation and extension.

**Dataset**

This project uses the TrackML Particle Identification dataset from Kaggle, which simulates hits from a typical collider experiment.

**Usage**

trackml_clustering_analysis.ipynb – Contains the full workflow from data loading, EDA, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.

**Preliminary Results**

This project applies clustering techniques to the 3D hit data, providing a foundational baseline for particle track reconstruction.

**Findings: K-Means vs DBSCAN**

**1) K-Means**

-> Requires pre-setting the number of clusters (K), which is impractical for thousands of tracks.

-> Produces equally-sized, convex-shaped clusters.

-> Tends to merge nearby tracks or split long tracks incorrectly.

-> Does not handle noise – every point is forced into a cluster.

**2) DBSCAN**

-> Does not require the number of clusters in advance.

-> Identifies arbitrarily-shaped clusters, better reflecting curved particle tracks.

-> Labels low-density hits as noise, which is useful in ignoring spurious hits.

**Comparison:**

i. K-Means is simple and fast but fundamentally limited for complex, irregular track geometries.

ii. DBSCAN better matches the nature of track data by capturing dense regions and discarding noise, though tuning parameters is crucial.

iii. Neither fully reconstructs tracks alone, but the insights provide a baseline for moving toward graph-based and ML-driven approaches.

**Future Work**

Future improvements will focus on:

i. Feature engineering (adding radial distance, angular features, and detector layer info).

ii. Graph-based approaches (constructing hit graphs and applying Graph Neural Networks).

iii. Advanced tracking techniques inspired by physics (Kalman filters, Hough transforms).

iv. Benchmarking against ground-truth particle IDs for quantitative evaluation.
