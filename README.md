# Particle-Track-Reconstruction
A personal project exploring the application of machine learning for reconstructing particle trajectories from the TrackML dataset. This repository contains implementations of clustering algorithms to group 3D hit coordinates in particle detectors, serving as a bridge between particle physics and machine learning.
